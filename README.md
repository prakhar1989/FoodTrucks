This is a fun application built to accompany the [docker curriculum](http://prakhar.me/docker-curriculum) which is a comprehensive tutorial on getting started with Docker targeted especially at beginners. The app is built with Flask on the backend and Elasticsearch is the search engine powering the searches The front-end is built with React and the beautiful maps are courtesy of Mapbox.  

If you find the design of the website a bit ostentatious, blame [Genius](http://genius.com) for giving me the idea of using this color scheme.  Lastly, the data for the food trucks is made available in public domain by [SF Data](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat).
